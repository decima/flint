# Flint

A simple and non-intrusive tool to deploy and manage your containerized applications with Docker on remote servers.

## Philosophy

Flint was designed with a core idea: simplicity and respect for your server environment. Unlike other deployment tools that take full control of your machine, Flint is designed to be as unintrusive as possible.

### Key Points:

*   **‚úÖ No Root Access:** No need for `sudo` or `root` permissions to operate. The tool runs entirely in user space.
*   **üêã Docker-Based:** Leverages the power and isolation of Docker to deploy your applications.
*   **üöÄ Automated Reverse Proxy:** A reverse proxy is automatically configured to expose your services, without complex manual configuration.
*   **üìÇ No Database:** No database to install or maintain. Configuration is managed through simple files.
*   **üí° Lightweight and Simple:** A single application to run to manage the entire lifecycle of your deployments.

## How It Works

Flint is an application written in **Go** that exposes a REST API (via the **Gin** framework) to manage deployments. It works by connecting to your remote server (e.g., via SSH) and using the machine's Docker API to manage containers.

1.  **Configuration:** You describe your applications in a simple configuration file (e.g., `docker-compose.yml` or a proprietary format).
2.  **Deployment:** The tool transfers the configuration to the remote server.
3.  **Launch:** It starts your Docker containers based on this configuration.
4.  **Routing:** It dynamically updates the reverse proxy's configuration (itself a Docker container) to route traffic to your new applications.

All of this without ever requiring elevated privileges on the host machine.
